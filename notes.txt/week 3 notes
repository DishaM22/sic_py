OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMING CONCEPTS:
1.Inheritence : allowing to inherit all attributes and methods of super/parent class to child/subclass
-adding new features /overriding the existing feature
-super():uplifting the values /features to parent class or automatically called by the constructor
-implementation of is_a relationship

pojo-play in old jawa obj

2.Polymorphism- note: there is no static polymorphism in python
 note:no compiletime in python so no static polymorphis (function over overloading)(only runtime)

3.Abstraction: it hides the actual implementation to give the user a proper interface for easier usage by user.
 
4.Encapsulation: binding of data inside the class( operate on that data into a single unit)
(when we encapsulate we get abstraction)

when a function is called:
-prologue
-business logic
-epilogue

*Static member:
class Cubical:
    str printer
    def __init__(self):
        chair
        mug
        computer
        drawer

    @static
    def get_printer(cls):
        return printer

Tree:
Tree is a DS
Non Linear ds
ACYCLIC DS(all paths in a DS are unique)

PDB:Python debugger
debugging is the skill of tracing the logic.

command to run a python script(program)in debug mode:(cmd)
#python -m pdb -your_script_name.py

or in code:
import pdb
pdb.set_trace()

#help (shortcut commands list)

Recursion:a function that calls itself ,either directly or indirectly .
types: direct.r,indirect.r,tail.r(the recursion call is the last call in the function)

Backtracking: a general algorithemic technique for solving problems incrementally.
   
lambda and regix:is used to extract all digit sequences (numbers) from each element in a list called data.
